HOW TO INSTALL (Windows)
------------------------------------------------
1. Open Settings
2. Search for "Mouse settings" and click on it
3. On the bottom of the menu, click "Additional Mouse Settings"
4. On the Mouse Properties window that pops up, click the "Pointers" tab on the top of the window.
5. In the Customize area, click each cursor and Browse..., then after opening the cursor's "Windows" folder, select the Umamusume cursor with the matching name.

Linux INFO
------------------------------------------------
You can find XCursor versions of the Windows cursors in the Linux subfolder.

These cursors are converted using win2xcur.
Unfortunately I do not own a machine running Linux so I do not know if these work, or how to install them.

Mac INFO
------------------------------------------------
You can find .png versions of the Windows cursors in the Mac subfolder.
Import these using Mousescape.

OPTIONAL
------------------------------------------------
If the Text Select cursor is too large, you can instead use "Text Select 2", which is more standard.

TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------------------------------------
If the cursor is translucent or buggy, turn on Pointer Shadow.
If the cursor reverts to the default Windows cursor when restarting, 
	1. Put these cursors in C:\Windows\Cursors.
	2. Save the cursors as a Cursor Scheme when applying.
